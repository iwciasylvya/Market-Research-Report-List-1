<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Voltage Reactor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Series Reactor</li><li>Shunt Reactor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high voltage reactor market is primarily categorized into series and shunt reactors. Series reactors are used to limit short-circuit currents and improve system stability by providing impedance in the current path, protecting equipment from overloads. Shunt reactors, on the other hand, are employed to manage reactive power and voltage levels in transmission networks, particularly in long lines, by absorbing excess reactive power. Both types play critical roles in enhancing grid reliability and efficiency in electrical networks.</p></p>
